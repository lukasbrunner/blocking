Download sample data set (for examples and tests)
-------------------------------------------------

Go to the ERA-Interim web page (an account my be required):
http://apps.ecmwf.int/datasets/data/interim-full-daily/levtype=pl/

Download the variable **Geopotential** at the **500hPa** pressure level as netCDF file. For a nice blocking pattern you should download at least one year (about 30MB). Save the data set in the _data_ folder and set the _INPATH_ variable in the scripts accordingly.
